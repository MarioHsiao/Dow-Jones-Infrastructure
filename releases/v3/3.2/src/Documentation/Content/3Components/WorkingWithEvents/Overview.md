Dow Jones Components provide a wide array of "events" to enable you to add interactivity to the page, by subscribing to events and reacting to them with event handlers.

Events can be handled in a loosely coupled manner via Pub/Sub pattern, or can be handled on a per instance basis for any specific instance of a component.
