Pure Javascript 							| Highcharts is solely based on native browser technologies and doesn't require client side plugins like Flash or Java. Furthermore you don't need to install anything on your server. No PHP or ASP.NET. Works with either the jQuery, MooTools or Prototype frameworks.
Effects										| Provides a rich effect API and ready to use effects.
Chart Types                                 | Supports line, spline, area, areaspline, colomn, bar, pie and scatter chart types. Any of these can be combinied in one chart.
Ease of Use                                 | Options are given in a JavaScript object notation structure, which is basically a set of keys and values connected by colons, separated by commas and grouped by curly brackets.

Numerous events supply hooks for programming agains the chart. In combination with jQuery, MooTools or Prototype's Ajax API, this opens for solutions like live charts constantly updating with values from the server, user supplied data and more.
External Data Loading                       | Highcharts takes the data in a JavaScript array, which can be defined in the local configuration object, in a separate file or even on a different site. Furthermore, the data can be handled over to Highcharts in any form, and a callback function used to parse the data into an array.
Export and Print                            | With the exporting module enabled, your users can export the chart to PNG, JPG, PDF or SVG format at the click of a button, or print the chart directly from the web page.
