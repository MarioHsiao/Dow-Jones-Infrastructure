PortalHeadlineList is a lightweight, client only Headline List component that renders minimal markup to display a list of Headlines in your page. 
The PortalHeadlineList offers 3 different views:

* **Default View** - A simple top-down list of Headline Titles along with configurable options to show Author, Source and Publication Date fields.
* **Timeline View** - A minimalistic top-down Headline list sorted by Publication Time with emphasis on **Publication Time**.
* **Author View** - Similar to default view with emphasis on **Authors**. The list of authors are placed before Headline Titles followed by Source and Publication Date.
