== Continuous Integration
In software engineering, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration[Continuous Integration] (CI) implements continuous processes of applying quality control - small pieces of effort, applied frequently. Continuous integration aims to improve the quality of software, and to reduce the time taken to deliver it, by replacing the traditional practice of applying quality control after completing all development.

=== Automated Builds
We have automated builds configured on the project trunk which compile the solution and execute the unit tests on every checkin. 
As such, any changes you check in have the potential to "break the build", which means that no one on the team can continue working!

TIP: See <<ContinuousIntegration_BestPractices>> for tips on how to avoid breaking the build.

==== The TFS Build Notifications system tray app
Unfortunately, we do not have email-based build notifications configured right now so until we do, it is your responsibility to make sure that your commits do not break the build. The easiest way to watch the current build status is using the TFS Build Notifications tool (the image below shows where it resides in my Start menu).

Configuration is a breeze: simply select the builds you wish to observe. Please watch the Continuous build at the very least.
