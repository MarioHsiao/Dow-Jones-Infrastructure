Dow Jones has made a significant investment in the ASP.NET MVC platform, customizing the platform with several extensions and a full-fledged "view component" framework.

Most of the back end data is exposed using set of REST enabled services called API. 
Together, these become the building blocks for any web application.

<img src="@Url.Content("~/Content/images/BuildingBlocks.png")" alt="Dow Jones UI Framework: High-level Architecture">

The framework consists of the following blocks:

- Dow Jones Core
- Dow Jones MVC Framework
- UI Components
- Composite Components
- Canvas Modules
- API Services (REST, Dashboard)

Each block contains a set of libraries that are designed to eliminate common, repetitive tasks and let the developer focus on building applications on top of these base libraries. 

In the coming sections, you'll learn more about each building block and the set of services that they provide.
