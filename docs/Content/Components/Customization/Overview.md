Dow Jones Components gives the flexibility to create the own HTML template or override the existing custom template defined in the component.
This template describes the overall structure and the look and the feel of the componet. 

By keeping the class names same from the originial HTML template defined in the component, the framework embraces the design of the component.
However to add your own class name we can keep the existing classes and add new class names to the component by following the css syntax.
