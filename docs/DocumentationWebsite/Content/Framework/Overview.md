WHAT ARE DOW JONES WIDGETS?
===========================
A Widget is a small and defined web-based visualization that carries out a specific task. When you hear the word "widget" you might think of the widgets you see on sites such as iGoogle, Pageflakes, Netvibes, or Live.com. Those widgets provide a one-way experience, typically to drive traffic to the content provider’s website. For example, on your Netvibes page you might have a list of headlines from the New York Times. To view the article for a headline you click on the headline, which takes you to nytimes.com. Beyond customizing the number of headlines that get displayed at the time, you don’t get to change the experience. Most widgets behave that way: your customization options are limited and you must leave your workflow to view the full content.

Dow Jones Widgets takes a different approach, putting control in your hands to create an experience that integrates seamlessly into your existing website, portal, and workflow. Using the headlines widget scenario again: you choose what happens when the user clicks the headline. By making use of Widget events, you can navigate the user to another page to view the article, display the article inline on the current web page, or maybe save the article for later reading. Furthermore, by using Dow Jones Widgets you are not limited to "pre-canned" content such as "Top News", "World", "Business", etc. Instead, you can use the Factiva Query Language to define the search and criteria that powers your Widget. Or, take advantage of one of our more than 125 editorially curated collections covering specific industries, regions, and other topics.
