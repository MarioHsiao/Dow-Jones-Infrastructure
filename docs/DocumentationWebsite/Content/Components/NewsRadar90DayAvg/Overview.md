The News Radar 90-day moving average Component enables the user to quickly understand the importance of selected news subjects or topics against their list of companies. By specifying a list of news subjects or topics (x-axis) and companies (y-axis) the Component renders a grid where for each subject-company intersection a weighted box indicates the change in news volume for the past 24 hours ("Today") compared to the daily average over the past 90 days.
