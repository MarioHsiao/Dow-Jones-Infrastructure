PortalHeadlineList is a lightweight, client only Headline List component that offers many pre-defined templates to display a list of Headlines in your page. 
The distinguishing features of PortalHeadlineList compared to its full featured counterpart HeadlineList are:
 
 * **Lightweight** - PortalHeadlineList renders minimal markup to the page, making it very lightweight and fast. 
 * **Client Only** - Unlike HeadlineList which offers both server-side and client-side data binding, PortalHeadlineList only supports client-side data binding.
 * **Built-in Views** - PortalHeadlineList offers 3 different views
	* **Default View** - A simple top-down list of Headline Titles along with configurable options to show Author, Source and Publication Date fields.
	* **Timeline View** - A minimalistic top-down Headline list sorted by Publication Time with emphasis on Publication Time.
	* **Author View** - Similar to default view with emphasis on **Authors**. The list of authors are placed before Headline Titles followed by Source and Publication Date.
