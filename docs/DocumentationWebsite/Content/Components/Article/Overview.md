The Article Widget is a UI control that displays the full content of an article. 
Use this widget in concert with the Headlines Widgets to easily display articles for selected headlines. 

The Article Widget also makes it easy to include Company and Executive Callout Widgets, giving users inline detail about the people and companies important to the content they're reading. 
The Article Widget also provides a convenient method to create a PDF or emailing the article.
