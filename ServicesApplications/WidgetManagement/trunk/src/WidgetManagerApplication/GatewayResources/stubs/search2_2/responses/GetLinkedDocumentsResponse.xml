              defies public opinion, Democrats on Iraq troops

            <para>
              WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - President George W.
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              bucked public opinion and the new Democratic Congress with a high-stakes gamble on more U.S. troops in Iraq, setting up a bruising political fight that could sink his fellow Republicans.
            </para>
            <para>
              Barely two months after a resounding Democratic election victory seen as a rejection of his Iraq policy,
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              upped the ante in a televised address by ordering 21,500 more troops to Iraq rather than pulling back on the U.S. commitment.
            </para>
          </leadParagraph>
          <tailParagraphs>
            <para>
              In his Wednesday speech
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              appeared to focus on history more than American politics, analysts said, making an audacious and perhaps final stab at turning around an increasingly unpopular war that will define his legacy as president.
            </para>
            <para>
              "We are seeing a president defying public opinion in a way that no modern president has," said Bruce Buchanan, a political analyst at the University of Texas and a longtime
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              watcher.
            </para>
            <para>"He has his eye on history. His most important jury is not the public but historians," he said. "For him, this is the defining issue of our times and he's hell-bent on avoiding surrender."</para>
            <para>
              Opinion polls show declining public confidence in
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              's conduct of the war, with solid majorities opposed to the proposal to send more troops to secure Baghdad.
            </para>
            <para>
              Democrats condemned the proposal and promised nonbinding votes in Congress on it, forcing Republicans to choose between breaking with
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              or embracing an unpopular policy just as the 2008 race for the White House gears up.
            </para>
            <para>"Obviously there is tremendous skepticism in the public about where this policy is going, and Republicans will be the ones to pay any price," said Andrew Taylor, a political analyst at North Carolina State University.</para>
            <para>
              A dozen Senate Republicans or more could break with
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              if the Senate holds a vote on the proposal, analysts said, weakening
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              even more as he enters the final two years of a lame duck presidency.
            </para>
            <para>
              Many Republicans said
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              still deserves backing on Iraq, and Republican presidential contenders largely fell in line with
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the Republican presidential frontrunner and a proponent of bolstering troop levels in Iraq.
            </para>
            <para>"Success or failure in Iraq is not a matter of partisan politics but a matter of national security," said former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. "I support the president's increase in troops."</para>
            <para>CRACKS IN REPUBLICAN SUPPORT</para>
            <para>
              But cracks began to appear in what has been for years largely solid Republican support for
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              on the war. Minnesota Republican Sen. Norm Coleman, who faces a tough re-election fight in 2008, said he opposed the increase in troops.
            </para>
            <para>"It is not a strategy for victory," Coleman said.</para>
            <para>Republican Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas, a conservative and a longshot contender for president, was in Baghdad on Wednesday and met Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.</para>
            <para>"I do not believe that sending more troops to Iraq is the answer," said Brownback. "Iraq requires a political rather than a military solution."</para>
            <para>For Democrats, the proposal offered the first chance to flex their new muscle in Congress, although Democratic congressional leaders were hesitant to try to cut off funding for the war.</para>
            <para>
              "The president's decision is wrong for Iraq and wrong for America -- and it's time for the new Congress to stop
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              from stubbornly pursuing his failed strategy in Iraq," Democratic presidential contender John Edwards said.
            </para>
            <para>"Congress should make it clear to the president that he will not get any money to put more of our troops in harm's way until he provides a plan to turn responsibility of Iraq over to the Iraqi people and to ultimately leave Iraq," he said.</para>
            <para>A coalition of liberal and Democratic activist groups including labor unions and veterans' groups said they would launch a national campaign against the proposal on Thursday.</para>
            <para>
              Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack called on communities across America to pass a resolution opposing the troop increase.
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              's plan, he said, "will make his big Iraq mistake even bigger."
            </para>
            <para>
              Buchanan said
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              's refusal to back down on Iraq was a reflection of his views on leadership.
            </para>
            <para>"In his own mind, leadership is defined by a willingness, often demonstrated, to buck public opinion. To him, that's the way you signal you are a strong leader," he said.</para>

              WASHINGTON - When President
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              goes before the American people tonight to outline his new strategy for Iraq, he will be doing something he has avoided since the invasion of Iraq in March 2003: Ordering his top military brass to take action they initially resisted and advised against.
            </para>
            <para>
              On Tuesday, ahead of
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              's speech, Democratic leaders said that they intended to hold symbolic votes in the House and Senate on his plan to send more troops to Baghdad, forcing Republicans to take a stand on the proposal and seeking to isolate the president politically over his handling of the war.They scheduled a vote for next week.
            </para>
          </leadParagraph>
          <tailParagraphs>
            <para>
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              talks frequently of his disdain for micromanaging the war effort and for second-guessing his commanders. "It's important to trust the judgment of the military when they're making military plans,"
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              said in an interview last month. "I'm a strict adherer to the command structure."
            </para>
            <para>
              But over the past two months, as the security situation in Iraq has deteriorated and U.S. public support for the war has dropped,
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              has pushed back against his top military advisers and the commanders in Iraq. He has fashioned a plan that adds up to 20,000 troops to the 132,000 U.S. service members already there. As
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              plans it, the military will soon be "surging" in Iraq two months after an election many Democrats interpreted as a mandate to begin withdrawing troops.
            </para>
            <para>Pentagon insiders say members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have long opposed the increase in troops and are only grudgingly going along with the plan because they have been promised that the military escalation will be matched by renewed political and economic efforts in Iraq.</para>
            <para>
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              's decision appears to mark the first major disagreement between the White House and key elements of the Pentagon over the Iraq war since Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, then the Army chief of staff, split with the administration in the spring of 2003 over the planned size of the occupation force, which he regarded as too small.
            </para>
            <para>Grudgingly going along?</para>
            <para>
              It may also be a sign of increasing assertiveness from a commander in chief described by former aides as relatively passive about questioning the advice of his military advisers. In going for more troops,
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              is picking an option that seems to have little favor beyond the White House and a handful of hawks on Capitol Hill and in think tanks who have been promoting the idea almost since the time of the invasion.
            </para>
            <para>
              This impulse may well expose
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              to more criticism from Democrats on Capitol Hill, who have sharply condemned him for not listening to Shinseki's counsel in the beginning.
            </para>
            <para>Democrats lining up</para>
            <para>
              Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., on Tuesday introduced legislation to require
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              to get congressional approval before sending more troops to Iraq.
            </para>

              "President

              should not be permitted to escalate the war further and send an even larger number of our troops into harm's way, without a clear and specific new authorization from Congress," Kennedy said. He described the Iraq war as "George
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              's Vietnam."
            </para>
            <para>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office announced that the House would also take up a resolution in opposition to a troop increase. House Democrats were scheduled to meet today to consider whether to interrupt their carefully choreographed 100-hour, two week-long rollout of their domestic agenda this month to address the Iraq war.</para>
            <para>
              In both chambers, Democrats made clear that the resolutions - which would do nothing in practical terms to block
              <hlt>Bush</hlt>
              's intention to increase the U.S. military presence in Iraq - would be the minimum steps they would pursue.
            </para>
            <para>They did not rule out seeking to cap number of troops being deployed to Iraq or limiting funding for the war - steps that could provoke a constitutional and political showdown over the president's power to wage war.</para>
