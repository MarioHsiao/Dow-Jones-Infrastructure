Dow Jones Components provides the flexibility to override the default defined template by allowing you to create a custom HTML template which can then be associated to the component.
This template describes the overall structure and the look and the feel of the componet. 

By keeping the class names the same as the originial HTML template defined in the component, the framework simply renders the UX based on the layout in the new template.
However to add your own class name we can keep the existing classes and add new class names to the component by following the css syntax.
