##### jQuery

###### Overview
jQuery is a cross-browser JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML and working with various browsrs DOM implementations. It was released in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by John Resig. 

jQuery is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries in use today. Comparable libraries also include DOJO, YUI and MooTools. It is free, open source software, dual-licensed under the MIT License or the GNU General Public License, Version 2. 

jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and web applications.

Microsoft and Nokia have announced plans to bundle jQuery on their platforms, Microsoft is adopting it initially within Visual Studio for use within Microsoft's ASP.NET AJAX framework and ASP.NET MVC Framework while Nokia has integrated it into their Web Run-Time widget development platform.
