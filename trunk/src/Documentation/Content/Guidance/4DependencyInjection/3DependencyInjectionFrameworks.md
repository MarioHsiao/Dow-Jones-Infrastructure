Though the example in <a href="#dependencyinjectioninaction">Dependency Injection in Action</a> is a good example of leveraging Dependency Injection, it is also quite simplistic - real world dependencies are often much deeper and more complex than the simple relationship between an analysis service and a data access service. 
Much more likely, both services would have quite a few more dependencies and be buried deeper in the application stack that the ConsoleRunner entry point shown. 
As these relationships grow deeper and more complex, tools such as Dependency Injection Frameworks (aka Dependency Injection Containers) greatly ease the burden of managing the relationships and dependencies between the various components of a software system. 
In this way, developers can declare dependencies in their code using dependency injection techniques listed above while letting a Dependency Injection Framework decipher the resulting complex object graphs and create dependency instances as needed.
