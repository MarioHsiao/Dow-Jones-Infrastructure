> Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot of the functional programming support that you would expect in jQuery or other JavaScriptframeworks, but without extending any of the built-in JavaScript objects.

Underscore provides 60-odd functions that support both the usual functional suspects: `map`, `select`, `invoke` — as well as more specialized helpers: `function binding`, `javascript templating`, `deep equality testing`, and so on. It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so modern browsers will use the native implementations of `forEach`, `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, `every`, `some` and `indexOf`.
